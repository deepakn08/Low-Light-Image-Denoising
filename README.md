# Extreme Low Light Image Denoising

This project presents an innovative approach to image denoising, focusing on enhancing dark images through the application of a multi-wavelet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model complemented by channel attention mechanisms.



## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to the authors of the research paper Multi-Level Wavelet CNN paper which inspired our approach of model in our project.

## Inference/Evaluation
To expermiment with saved model ,download the model in joblob file from the github repo.

And run the main.ipynb notebook.
